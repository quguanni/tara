.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Tiger is a package consisting of Bourne Shell scripts, C code and
data files which is used for checking for security problems on a
UNIX system.  It scans system configuration files, file systems,
and user configuration files for possible security problems and
reports them.  The command
.B tigexp(8)
can be used to obtain explanations of the problems reported by
.I tiger.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-B"
Specify the directory where
.I tiger
is installed.  If not specified, the current directory is used.
.TP
.I "\-d"
Specify the name of the directory where
.I tiger
will write the security report.  This defaults to the current directory.
The filename of the report will
be of the form 
.RI 'security.report. hostname.date.time.'
.TP
.I "\-w"
Specify a directory to use for creating scratch files.  This defaults
to
.I /tmp.
.TP
.I "\-b"
Specify the directory which contains (or will contain) the binaries
generated from the C modules.  If the systems directories contain
all the binaries, they will be used directly from there.  If not,
then if the
.I bindir
contains the binaries, these will be used.  If none are found in
either place, then an attempt will be made to compile the C code
and install the executables into the
.I bindir.
.TP
.I "\-c"
Specify an alternate name for the
.I tigerrc
control file.  The default is 'tigerrc'.
.TP
.I "\-e"
This option will cause explanations to be inserted into the security
report following each message.  This can greatly increase the size
of the report, as explanations may appear repeatedly.
.TP
.I "\-E"
This option indicates that a separate explanation report should be
created, with explanations for each type of message only appearing
once.  The filename of the explanation report will be of the form
.RI 'explain.report. hostname.date.time.'
.TP 
.I "\-H"
This option will format the report into HTML creating local links
to the problem descriptions.
.TP
.I "\-S"
This option indicates that a surface level check of the configuration
files of any diskless clients served by this machine should be checked
at the same time.  The checks will not be as in depth as they would be
if run on the client itself.
