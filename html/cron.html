<A NAME="cron001w"><P><B>Code [cron001w]</B><P>
The listed cron entry does not use a full pathname for the listed command
(or if a shell is specified, the name of the shell script). Full pathnames
should be used for cron entries.

<A NAME="cron002"><P><B>Code [cron002]</B><P>
The listed cron entry uses an executable or file which is not owned
by the owner of the cron entry, and is also not owned by a system
account (root or bin, etc). For root cron entries, these are especially
dangerous. Note that the actual problem may be with a directory in
the path to the file, not the file itself.

<A NAME="cron003"><P><B>Code [cron003]</B><P>
The listed cron entry uses a file or executable which has group write
permissions, world write permissions or both. This can allow the
system to be compromised. For root cron entries, this is especially
dangerous. Note that the actual problem may be with a directory in
the path to the file, not the file itself.
