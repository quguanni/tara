<A NAME="acc001w"><P><B>Code [acc001w]</B><P>
The listed login ID is disabled in some manner ('*' in passwd field, etc),
but the login shell for the login ID is a valid shell (from /etc/shells
or the system equivalent). A valid shell can potentially enable the
login ID to continue to be used. The login shell should be changed
to something that doesn't exist, or to something like /bin/false.

<A NAME="acc002i"><P><B>Code [acc002i]</B><P>
The listed login ID is disabled, but has a potentially valid shell.
These can usually be safely ignored.

<A NAME="acc003w"><P><B>Code [acc003w]</B><P>
The listed login ID is disabled in some manner ('*' in passwd field, etc),
but the .forward file is setup to execute programs. This can allow the
login ID to continue to be used despite the fact that it is disabled.
The .forward file should be checked and probably removed.

<A NAME="acc004w"><P><B>Code [acc004w]</B><P>
The listed login ID is disabled in some manner ('*' in passwd field, etc),
but a non-zero length .rhosts file. This can allow the login ID to continue
to be used. Unless this has been specifically set up to provide some
service, it should be removed.

<A NAME="acc005w"><P><B>Code [acc005w]</B><P>
The listed login ID is disabled in some manner ('*' in passwd field, etc),
but has a 'cron' file or 'cron' entries. This allows commands to be executed
on behalf of the login ID, potentially allowing access to the login ID.
These should be removed unless specifically set up to provide a service.

<A NAME="acc006w"><P><B>Code [acc006w]</B><P>
The home directory of the listed login ID has group write permission,
world write permission or both enabled. This allows new files to be added
(and existing files potentially removed) by others. The write permissions
should be removed.

<A NAME="acc007a"><P><B>Code [acc007a]</B><P>
The listed login ID has a '.hushlogin' file which is not zero-length.
This file is normally a zero length file. This file is frequently used
by intruders as a place to store captured passwords. This file should
be looked at. If it appears to be such a log file, then the system should
be regarded as being compromised. The system should be thoroughly checked
and cleaned.

<A NAME="acc008w"><P><B>Code [acc008w]</B><P>
The listed login ID has a configuration file which has group write permission,
word write permission, or both enabled. This allows others to change this
file, compromising the login ID.

<A NAME="acc009a"><P><B>Code [acc009a]</B><P>
The login ID 'sync' has no password and the shell is not /bin/sync, which
is what it normally is. This could indicate an intrusion has occurred.
If the shell is one of the normal shells (/bin/sh, /bin/csh, etc), then
this is very likely the situation. The login ID should be disabled, or
the shell reset to '/bin/sync'.

<A NAME="acc010a"><P><B>Code [acc010a]</B><P>
The listed login ID has a user ID of zero (0) and does not have a password.
This could indicate an intrusion has occurred. This should be disabled
immediately and the machine checked and cleaned.

<A NAME="acc010aw"><P><B>Code [acc010aw]</B><P>
The listed login ID has a user ID of zero (0) and does not have a password.
This could indicate an intrusion has occurred. This should be disabled
immediately and the machine checked and cleaned.

On this system, comments are not allowed in the password file. An attempt
to comment out an entry simply results in a login ID which begins with a
'#'. See message ID 'acc013w' for more information.

<A NAME="acc011w"><P><B>Code [acc011w]</B><P>
The listed login ID does not have a password. Anyone can use this account,
allowing them to explore the system for other security problems. Unless
this is a secure captured account, this should be corrected.

<A NAME="acc012w"><P><B>Code [acc012w]</B><P>
The listed login ID has a user ID of zero (0) and is not the 'root'
account. This should be checked to see if it is legitimate. In any
case, having login ID's with a user ID of zero tends to lead to security
problems, and should be avoided (except for 'root')

On this system, comments are not allowed in the password file. An attempt
to comment out an entry simply results in a login ID which begins with a
'#'. For example:
<P>
#joeuser:zqa4324x2423x:234:23:Joe User:/home/joeuser:/bin/csh
<P>
indicates a user with the username '#joeuser'. The account has not
been disabled, it has simply been renamed. Such entries should be
deleted from the system.
