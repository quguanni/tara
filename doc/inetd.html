either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a possible

The 'rexd' service is very insecure and should never be enabled.
It should be disabled immediately by editing the inetd.conf file
and removing the 'rexd' entry, and sending a HUP signal to the
'inetd' process.  For AIX systems, CERT Advisory CA-92:05 is applicable.

'inetd' is using the indicated executable for a port other than
what would normally be expected for this port.  This may indicate
a backdoor into the system and should be checked.  If anything
unusual is found, the system should be checked for other signs
of intrusion.
