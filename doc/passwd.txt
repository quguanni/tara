%pass001w
The listed username occurs more than once in the same file.  This
indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected.
%pass002w

usually indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected.  On
many systems, uid 0 (zero) and uid 1 (one) are often used for multiple
usernames.  It is usually to completely disable all of the usernames
except for `root' for uid zero and all of the usernames for uid one.

indicates a configuration problem that should be corrected.

(uid) is different in them.  This can lead to unexpected access to
resources if not corrected.
%pass005w
The listed userid (uid) occurs in separate password sources, but the
usernames are different.  This can lead to unexpected access to resources
if not corrected.
