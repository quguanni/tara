--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID bin is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

The listed login ID is disabled in some manner ('*' in passwd field, etc),
but the login shell for the login ID is a valid shell (from /etc/shells
or the system equivalent).  A valid shell can potentially enable the
login ID to continue to be used.  The login shell should be changed to
something that doesn't exist, or to something like /bin/false.

( from /etc/passwd  -> bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:   )

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID daemon is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID ftp is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID gdm is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID jenny is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID kim is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID lp is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID mail is disabled, but still has a valid shell.

--WARN-- [acc001w] Login ID root is disabled, but still has a valid shell.


--WARN-- [acc006w] Login ID mail's home directory (/var/spool/mail) has group
`mail' write access.

The home directory of the listed login ID has group write permission,
world write permission or both enabled.  This allows new files to be
added (and existing files potentially removed) by others.  The write
permissions should be removed.

# Checking accounts from /etc/passwd...
--WARN-- [rcmd006w] User buim's .rhosts file has group `users' readandgroup
`users' write access.

The indicated .rhosts file has permissions other than read and write
for the owner of the file.  Allowing others to read the .rhosts file
provides information about other "trusted" hosts which may allow them to
compromise this host, the trusted hosts, or both.  The permissions should
be at most read and write for the owner of the file.  Note that on some
systems, because of network file systems, it is necessary to have world
read access to the .rhosts file so that client machines can access the
.rhosts file.  Most systems correctly handle this situation without the
need for the world read access.  If yours does not, you should bring it
to the attention of your vendor.

--WARN-- [rcmd006w] User jenny's .rhosts file has group `root' and world read
access.

--WARN-- [rcmd006w] User kim's .rhosts file has group `root' read access.

# Performing check of anonymous FTP...
--WARN-- [ftp006w] Anonymous FTP enabled, but directory does not exist.


Anonymous ftp appears to be setup, but the directory indicated as the
ftp directory does not exist.  This indicates either a misconfiguration
or an old setup.  This should be corrected by either correcting the
directory name, or deleting the ftp account.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.

--FAIL-- [inet002f] Service echo is assigned to port 4/ddp which should be
7/tcp.

The indicated service is assigned to the wrong port.  This indicates
either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a possible sign
of an intrusion.  This should be checked and corrected.  If it is not
apparent why it is like this, the system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion.

--FAIL-- [inet002f] Service echo is assigned to port 4/ddp which should be
7/udp.

The indicated service is assigned to the wrong port.  This indicates
either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a possible sign
of an intrusion.  This should be checked and corrected.  If it is not
apparent why it is like this, the system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion.


--FAIL-- [inet003f] The port for service imap is assigned to service imap2.

The indicated port number is assigned to the wrong service.  This
indicates either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a
possible sign of an intrusion.  This should be checked and corrected.
If it is not apparent why it is like this, the system should be checked
for other signs of intrusion.
